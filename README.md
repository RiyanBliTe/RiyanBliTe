## Hi everyone, I'm Bohdan ðŸ‘‹

#### C and C++ programming languages as a tool for creating incredible things :rocket: develop projects on Qt framework and also work with Visual Sudio. Work with Unreal Engine to create new fascinating worlds :video_game:

##### Let's get acquainted with my works :arrow_down:

<h2 align="center"><a  href="https://github.com/RiyanBliTe/CarF">CarF</a></h2> 

#### This is a _client-server_ application of an online car seat shop. The development of this application was accompanied by the fact that I studied the **_Qt framework_** and data transfer via _TCP IP protocol_.

##### What I learned to do

* Understood the work of main libraries in the Qt framework.
* Learned to compose widgets in a visual editor.
* Connect the client to the server.
* Send the data format to the server or client.
* Work with the database through the server.
* Parse input lines and compose output.
* Develop your widgets to work with data.
* Learned to work with slots and signals in the Qt framework.
* And much **more** :wink:

##### Let's take a look at the app

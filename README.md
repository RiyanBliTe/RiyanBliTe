## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

#### C and C++ programming languages as a tool for creating incredible things :rocket: develop projects on Qt framework and also work with Visual Sudio. Work with Unreal Engine to create new fascinating worlds :video_game:

##### Let's get acquainted with my works :arrow_down:

#### This is a _client-server_ application of an online car seat shop. The development of this application was accompanied by the fact that I studied the **_Qt framework_** and data transfer via _TCP IP protocol_.

##### What I learned to do:

* Understood the work of main libraries in the Qt framework.
* Learned to compose widgets in a visual editor.
* Connect the client to the server.
* Send the data format to the server or client.
* Work with the database through the server.
* Parse input lines and compose output.
* Develop your widgets to work with data.
* Learned to work with slots and signals in the Qt framework.
* And much **more** :wink:

#### This is a _console game_ of the _arcade_ genre :gun:, which is written entirely by _the paradigm of procedural programming_ using C++.

##### The problems I solved:

* Work with a large array of data.
* Optimize the application for different displays.
* Improved knowledge of structures, pointers and links.
* Learned to make a multi-file project.
* Developed many logical operations.
* And tested the game :sweat_smile:.

### I also have a few more versions of the game I once wrote on Java

* [Bubble world 1.0](https://github.com/RiyanBliTe/Bubble_world_1)
* [Bubble world 1.2](https://github.com/RiyanBliTe/Bubble_world_1.2)

##### But once I stopped encouraging their development, so it's a _dead project_

### A little about me
